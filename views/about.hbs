                <p>AC/DC are an Australian rock band formed in Sydney in 1973 by Scottish-born
                    brothers Malcolm and Angus Young.[1] Their music has been variously described as hard rock, blues
                    rock, and heavy metal,[2] but the band themselves call it simply "rock and roll".[3]
                    AC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, 1975's High Voltage.
                    Membership subsequently stabilised around the Young brothers, singer Bon Scott, drummer Phil Rudd,
                    and bassist Mark Evans. Evans was fired from the band in 1977 and replaced by Cliff Williams, who
                    has appeared on every AC/DC album since 1978's Powerage. In February 1980, about seven months after
                    the release of their breakthrough album Highway to Hell, Scott died of acute alcohol poisoning after
                    a night of heavy drinking.[4] The group considered disbanding but elected to stay together, bringing
                    in longtime Geordie vocalist Brian Johnson as Scott's replacement.[5] Later that year, the band
                    released their first album with Johnson, Back in Black, which was dedicated to Scott's memory. The
                    album launched AC/DC to new heights of success and became one of the best selling albums of all
                    time.
                    The band's eighth studio album, For Those About to Rock We Salute You (1981), was their first album
                    to reach number one in the United States. Prior to the release of their next album, Flick of the
                    Switch (1983), Rudd left the band and was replaced by Simon Wright, being in turn replaced by Chris
                    Slade in 1989. The band experienced a commercial resurgence in the early nineties with the release
                    of their twelfth studio album The Razors Edge (1990); it would be their only album to feature Slade,
                    who was dismissed from AC/DC in 1994 and replaced by a returning Rudd. Rudd has since recorded five
                    more albums with the band, starting with, and including, Ballbreaker (1995). Their fifteenth studio
                    album Black Ice was the second-highest-selling album of 2008, and their biggest chart hit since For
                    Those About to Rock, eventually reaching No.1 worldwide.[6]
                    The band's line-up remained the same for twenty years, until 2014 with Malcolm Young's retirement
                    due to early-onset dementia (he died in 2017) and Rudd's legal troubles. Malcolm was replaced by his
                    nephew Stevie Young, who debuted on AC/DC's 2014 album Rock or Bust, and on its accompanying tour,
                    previous drummer Chris Slade filled in for Rudd. In 2016, Johnson was advised to stop touring due to
                    worsening hearing loss. Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose stepped in as the band's vocalist for the
                    remainder of that year's dates. Long-term bass player and background vocalist Cliff Williams retired
                    from AC/DC at the end of the Rock or Bust tour in 2016 and the group entered a four-year hiatus. A
                    reunion of the Rock or Bust lineup was announced in September 2020 and the band's seventeenth studio
                    album Power Up was released two months later.
                    AC/DC have sold more than 200 million records worldwide, including 75 million albums in the United
                    States, making them the ninth-highest-selling artist in the United States and the 16th-best-selling
                    artist worldwide.[7][8][9] Back in Black has sold an estimated 50 million units worldwide, making it
                    the second-highest-selling album by any artist, and the highest-selling album by any band. The album
                    has sold 22 million units in the US, where it is the sixth-highest-selling album of all
                    time.[10] AC/DC ranked fourth on VH1's list of the "100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"[11][12] and
                    were named the seventh "Greatest Heavy Metal Band of All Time" by MTV.[13] In 2004, AC/DC ranked No.
                    72 on the Rolling Stone list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time". Producer Rick Rubin, who
                    wrote an essay on the band for the Rolling Stone list, referred to AC/DC as "the greatest rock and
                    roll band of all time".[14] In 2010, VH1 ranked AC/DC number 23 in its list of the "100 Greatest
                    Artists of All Time".[15]
